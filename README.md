# BAMAZON
CLI App - node.js and mysql databases

### Overview
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
